DE2-COM2 Group project is based on the game Pac-man. Groups must build an working function for both the Pac-man and the Ghost. Rules for the Pac-man game are as follows:

1. You cannot change the rules of the game PAC-MAN.
2. Each team must program one PacMan and one Ghost.
3. You need to submit your complete source code for inspection.
4. Your source code will be evaluated on quality and documentation.
5. You need to present your code in front of everyone and explain how it works.
6. Any algorithms are allowed, provided that you can explain exactly how they work.
7. Each group participates with their code (PacMan + Ghost) in the programming competition in DRAW week.
