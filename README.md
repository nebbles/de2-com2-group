For understanding our agent logic, see the wikis for both [pacman](http://github.com/nebbles/de2-com2-group/wiki/Pacman-Logic) and [ghost](http://github.com/nebbles/de2-com2-group/wiki/Ghost-Logic).

1. You cannot change the rules of the game PAC-MAN.
2. Each team must program one PacMan and one Ghost.
3. You need to submit your complete source code for inspection.
4. Your source code will be evaluated on quality and documentation.
5. You need to present your code in front of everyone and explain how it works.
6. Any algorithms are allowed, provided that you can explain exactly how they work.
7. Each group participates with their code (PacMan + Ghost) in the programming competition in DRAW week.
